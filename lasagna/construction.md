Constructing the lasagna
========================

Notes
-----
* Throw in a couple extra lasagna strips just-in-case some get messed up.
* Bring water to a boil THEN add salt.
* Make sure pasta water is VERY salty.
* Noodles are not fully cooked in the boiling water since they will finish cooking when baking the lasagna.
* Baking pan should be at least 9"x13".
* You can use freshly shredded mozzarella or pre-shredded, the important thing is that it is low-moisture. High moisture ends up making a soupy lasagna.
* Allowing the lasagna to sit for 30 minutes might sound like a lot, but it will still be very hot and it will stay together much better once you start cutting it if you allow it to rest (it had a long journey, it's tired).

Ingredients
-----------
* 9x lasagna noodle strips
* 4-6 oz sliced pepperonis
* 16oz low-moisture mozzarella
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan

Prep
----
* Shred mozzarella (if not pre-shredded)
* Grate parmesan

Directions
----------
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Bring water to a boil and parboil lasagna noodles for 6 minutes.
3. Place a *thin* layer of sauce at the bottom of the baking pan.
4. Start creating layers of noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/sauce. Repeat these layers once more.
5. Create the final layer with noodles/sauce/pepperonis/mozzarella/parmesan.
6. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.
7. Remove aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes more.
8. Sprinkle some leftover fresh basil or some dried parsley on the top for some presentation points.
9. Allow the lasagna to sit for 30 minutes.
