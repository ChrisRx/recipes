Constructing the lasagna
========================

Notes
-----
* Throw in a couple extra lasagna strips just-in-case some get messed up.
* Bring water to a boil THEN add salt.
* Make sure pasta water is VERY salty.
* Noodles are not fully cooked in the boiling water since they will finish cooking when baking the lasagna.
* Baking pan should be at least 9"x13".
* You can use freshly shredded mozzarella or pre-shredded, the important thing is that it is low-moisture. High moisture ends up making a soupy lasagna.
* Allowing the lasagna to sit for 30 minutes might sound like a lot, but it will still be very hot and it will stay together much better once you start cutting it if you allow it to rest (it had a long journey, it's tired).
* Rehydrating the sauce with pasta water adds so much flavor, it's crazy. I try not to over-salt the bolognese with the expectation that I will being adding something like this or seasoning to taste again later.
* I've layered noodles/ricotta/mozzarella/sauce before as well, but so far it hasn't made much difference.

Ingredients
-----------
* 9x lasagna noodle strips
* 4-6 oz sliced pepperonis
* 16oz low-moisture mozzarella
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan

Prep
----
* Shred mozzarella (if not pre-shredded)
* Grate parmesan

Directions
----------
1. Start reheating refrigerated sauce on low. Stir occasionally.
2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
3. Bring water to a boil and parboil lasagna noodles for 4 minutes.
4. After only 5 minutes, grab 2 cups of pasta water and set aside, then remove lasagna.
5. Add 1-2 cups of pasta water back into sauce.
5. Place a *thin* layer of sauce at the bottom of the baking pan.
6. Start creating layers of noodles/sauce/mozzarella/ricotta. Repeat these layers once more.
7. Create the final layer with noodles/sauce/pepperonis/mozzarella/parmesan.
8. Cover baking pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.
9. Remove aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes more.
10. Allow the lasagna to sit for 30 minutes.
