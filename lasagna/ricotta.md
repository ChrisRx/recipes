Ricotta mixture
===============

Notes
-----
* I think the seasoning here could be improved.
* Instead of parmesan, pecorino romano might be better since it has a stronger flavor.

Ingredients
-----------
* 15 oz ricotta
* 1 large egg
* 1 tbsp dried parsley flakes
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano # TODO: fresh chopped basil instead of oregano? maybe remove altogether
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan

Prep
----
* Slightly beat egg
* Grate parmesan

Directions
----------
1. Combine all ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl.
