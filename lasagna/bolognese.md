Rag√π bolognese
==============

Notes
-----
* **Take care to not burn the fond from the beef/pork/lamb and pancetta.**
* You can do the whole thing at medium-high heat, but if you need to reduce the heat to avoid burning that is a-ok.
* It is ok to simmer longer if the sauce needs to reduce more to achieve the desired consistency.
* This will make one lasagna, but can be scaled up to make more bolognese that can be frozen and used later.
* I'm going to try substituting veal instead of the ground lamb.
* If using regular concentration tomato paste, just use twice as much.
* I used salt pork instead of pancetta and it was a bit more work but tasted just as good.
* I used minced garlic this time, but I think you can do pretty much anything here (fresh chopped or maybe even just powder), it is mostly for aromatics so it doesn't matter if the allicin breaks down while it reduces.
* I simplified the bolognese because the nuances of a more developed sauce are not going to be as noticeable in a lasagna.  I also wanted the star of the flavor to be more the meat itself than a bunch of seasoning.
* I like adding closer to 4 oz of tomato paste for that stronger tomato flavor.
* While the sauce is reducing, the fat that comes to the surface will emulsify and integrate back into the sauce on its own, so no need to skim it out (also it tastes good).

* 1/2 lb ground pork
