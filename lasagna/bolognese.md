Rag√π bolognese
==============

Notes
-----
* Use a cast iron dutch oven and make sure you have room in the refrigerator for it to rest overnight.
* Take care to not burn the fond from the beef/pork and pancetta.
* You can do the whole thing at medium-high heat, but if you need to reduce the heat to avoid burning that is a-ok.
* It is ok to simmer longer if the sauce needs to reduce more to achieve the desired consistency.
* I haven't tried yet, but it might be good to add some veal into the ground meats.
* Don't go crazy with the red pepper flakes because the layer of pepperonis ends up spicing it up pretty good.
* This will make one lasagna, but can be scaled up to make more bolognese that can be frozen and used later.
