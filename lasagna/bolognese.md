Ragù bolognese
==============

Notes
-----
* Use a cast iron dutch oven (probably 6.5 quart) and make sure you have room in the refrigerator for it to rest overnight.
* Take care to not burn the fond from the beef/pork and pancetta.
* You can do the whole thing at medium-high heat, but if you need to reduce the heat to avoid burning that is a-ok.
* It is ok to simmer longer if the sauce needs to reduce more to achieve the desired consistency.
* I haven't tried yet, but it might be good to add some veal into the ground meats.
* Don't go crazy with the red pepper flakes because the layer of pepperonis ends up spicing it up pretty good.
* This will definitely make more sauce than you need, but it isn't always easy to get the right amount of beef and pork at the grocery so this will probably make enough sauce for two lasagnas, so you can either half the meat and tomatoes (keep everything else the same), or jar the sauce so you don't have to make it next time! Mainly just try to stick with the ratio of 28 oz of tomatoes for every 1 lb of meat.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 1/2 - 2 lb ground beef and ground pork
* 3 oz tomato paste (double concentrated)
* 2 x 28 oz whole peeled tomatoes canned (San Marzano)
* 4-6 oz sliced mushrooms (just like the ones that come in a jar)
* 1 cup beef broth
* 1 cup dry red wine
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 5x cloves garlic
* 3x carrots
* 1x white onion
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan

* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 1 tbsp dried basil
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes (don't over do it)
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp salt

Prep
----
* Shred carrots
* Dice white onion
* Drain sliced mushrooms
* Crush or mince the garlic (I use a zester sometimes ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯)
* Grate parmesan

Directions
----------
1. Add 1 tbsp olive oil to a dutch oven and brown ground beef/pork. Remove and drain.
2. Cook pancetta until fat is rendered. *Be sure not to burn the fond*
3. Add remaining olive oil along with crushed garlic, shredded carrots, and diced onion.
4. Add tomato paste and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes.
5. Add red wine and deglaze pan.
6. Add beef broth and allow it to reduce slightly.
7. Add canned tomatoes (including water in can), drained mushroom slices, and seasoning (oregano, basil, bay leaves, red pepper flakes, pepper and salt). Let them get acquainted. Stir and allow the rest of the liquid to reduce into the sauce.
8. Return ground beef/pork to pan. Stir in the grated parmesan. Add parmesan rind and fresh basil, if available.
9. Lower heat to a high simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Stir very infrequently
10. Remove from heat and let sit for 15 minutes before placing in refrigerator. *Make sure to remove the bay leaves* (and any remaining parmesan rind).
