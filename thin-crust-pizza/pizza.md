Pizza
=====

Notes
-----
* I'm using a Lloyd 16 inch PSTK cutter pan
* The parmesan cheese is to emulate Pizza Hut "fairy dust" seasoning, so I think using the shelf stable stuff is probably ok (i.e. the Kraft pre-grated shaker)

Ingredients
-----------
* 15-20x pepperoni slices
* 2-3oz sliced mushrooms
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 1 tbsp grated parmesan cheese
* 7-8oz low-moisture mozzarella cheese
* 3oz monterey jack cheese
* 2-3 peeled garlic cloves
* 2 tbsp butter

Prep
----
* Grate cheese and toss to combine evenly
* Combine oregano and grated parmesan (to be sprinkled on pizza just before going in the oven)
* Microwave butter and garlic cloves for like 35s

Directions
----------
1. Preheat oven at 500-550F with a pizza stone for 1h
1. Roll out [dough](dough.md#cracker-style-dough) as flat as possible
2. Place dough in the pan, pressing the sides flush with the pan
3. Use a rolling pin over top of pan to "cut" excess dough
4. Add [sauce](sauce.md#sauce), spreading evenly in pan with a spoon
5. Sprinkle cheese mixture
6. Add pepperoni slices and mushrooms on top of cheese
7. Shake/sprinkle "fairy dust" seasoning over entire pizza
8. Bake in preheated oven for 10m.
9. Slowly drizzle garlic butter around crust and then let pizza rest
