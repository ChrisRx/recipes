Cracker-style Dough
===================

This makes 544g (19.2 oz) of cracker-style dough. I got this recipe following these two posts on the Pizza Making forums:

* https://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=67154.0

Notes
-----
* Should use table salt (instead of like kosher or sea salt)
* This makes 19.2 oz of dough, which should make more than is necessary for a 16 inch pizza
* Use the paddle attachment (instead of the dough hook)
* On my Kitchen Aid I only use speed 2 for everything
* While the dough was rising I placed it in the oven, turning it on briefly at the lowest temperature, and trying to keep the temperature around 100F. The dough was ready to use after about 5h.
* The dough is very low hydration, so no need to use extra flour, the dough is not sticky at all
